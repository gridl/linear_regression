# Talk

* Talk for [Inside Data](https://cyberlago.net/event/inside-data-bodensee-vol-i-lineare-regression-mit-tensorflow/) **will come soon**

# Notebooks 

The easiest to interactively work with the notebooks, is to use google [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (you will need to have a google account for that). In colab the notebook will be run in the cloud. For doing the hands-on part on your own computer you can either install anaconda or use the provided a docker container (you need no google account). See [https://tensorchiefs.github.io/dl_course_2018/](https://tensorchiefs.github.io/dl_course_2018/) for details.
