# Talk

* talk for inside data **will come soon**

# Notebooks 

The easiest way doing the notebooks, is to use google colab (you will need to have a google account for that). The notebook will be run in the cloud. For doing the hands-on part on your own computer you can either install anaconda or use the provided a docker container. See https://tensorchiefs.github.io/dl_course_2018/ for details.
