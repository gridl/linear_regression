* talk for inside data **will come soon**

# Notebooks 

The easiest way doing the notebooks, is to use google [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (you will need to have a google account for that). The notebook will be run in the cloud. For doing the hands-on part on your own computer you can either install anaconda or use the provided a docker container. See [https://tensorchiefs.github.io/dl_course_2018/](https://tensorchiefs.github.io/dl_course_2018/) for details.

# Solution

* Linear Regression with TensorFlow (standard graph based): [notebook static](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/linear_regression/blob/master/linear_regression_tf.ipynb) or [notebook interactive in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorchiefs/linear_regression/blob/master/linear_regression_tf.ipynb)

* Linear Regression with TensorFlow eager COMMING SOON: [notebook static](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/linear_regression/blob/master/linear_regression_tfeager.ipynb) or [notebook interactive in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorchiefs/linear_regression/blob/master/linear_regression_tfeager.ipynb)
